Aside from modelling application system models, I analyse user/business system requirements and respond to outages as well as contribute to all phases of the software development lifecycle. Additionally, I work on testing and debugging programs to meet business needs, as well as dealing with and occasionally directing third-party partners to help achieve business and technology initiatives.
